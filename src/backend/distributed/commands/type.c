 *
 * type.c
 *    Commands for TYPE statements.
 *    The following types are supported in citus
 *     - Composite Types
 *     - Enum Types
 *     - Array Types
 *
 *    Types that are currently not supporter:
 *     - Range Types
 *     - Base Types
 *
 *    Range types have a dependency on functions. We can only support Range
 *    types after we have function distribution sorted.
 *
 *    Base types are more complex and often involve c code from extensions.
 *    These types should be created by creating the extension on all the
 *    workers as well. Therefore types created during the creation of an
 *    extension are not propagated to the worker nodes.
 *
 *    Types will be created on the workers during the following situations:
 *     - on type creation (except if called in a transaction)
 *       By not distributing types directly when in a transaction allows
 *       the type to be used in a newly created table that will be
 *       distributed in the same transaction. In that case the type will be
 *       created just-in-time to allow citus' parallelism to work.
 *     - just-in-time
 *       When the type is not already distributed but used in an object
 *       that will distribute now. This allows distributed tables to use
 *       types that have not yet been propagated, either due to the
 *       transaction case abvove, or due to a type predating the citus
 *       extension.
 *     - node activation
 *       Together with all objects that are marked as distributed in citus
 *       types will be created during the activation of a new node to allow
 *       reference tables to use this type.
