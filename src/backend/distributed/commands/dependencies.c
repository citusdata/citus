 *
 * Note; only the actual objects are created via a separate session, the local records to
 * pg_dist_object are created in this session. As a side effect the objects could be
 * created on the workers without a catalog entry on the coordinator. Updates to the
 * objects on the coordinator are not propagated to the workers until the record is
 * visible on the coordinator.
 *
 * This is solved by creating the dependencies in an idempotent manner, either via
 * postgres native CREATE IF NOT EXISTS, or citus helper functions.
