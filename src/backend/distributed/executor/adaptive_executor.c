 *
 * adaptive_executor.c
 *
 * The adaptive executor executes a list of tasks (queries on shards) over
 * a connection pool per worker node. The results of the queries, if any,
 * are written to a tuple store.
 *
 * The concepts in the executor are modelled in a set of structs:
 *
 * - DistributedExecution:
 *     Execution of a Task list over a set of WorkerPools.
 * - WorkerPool
 *     Pool of WorkerSessions for the same worker which opportunistically
 *     executes "unassigned" tasks from a queue.
 * - WorkerSession:
 *     Connection to a worker that is used to execute "assigned" tasks
 *     from a queue and may execute unassigned tasks from the WorkerPool.
 * - ShardCommandExecution:
 *     Execution of a Task across a list of placements.
 * - TaskPlacementExecution:
 *     Execution of a Task on a specific placement.
 *     Used in the WorkerPool and WorkerSession queues.
 *
 * Every connection pool (WorkerPool) and every connection (WorkerSession)
 * have a queue of tasks that are ready to execute (readyTaskQueue) and a
 * queue/set of pending tasks that may become ready later in the execution
 * (pendingTaskQueue). The tasks are wrapped in a ShardCommandExecution,
 * which keeps track of the state of execution and is referenced from a
 * TaskPlacementExecution, which is the data structure that is actually
 * added to the queues and describes the state of the execution of a task
 * on a particular worker node.
 *
 * When the task list is part of a bigger distributed transaction, the
 * shards that are accessed or modified by the task may have already been
 * accessed earlier in the transaction. We need to make sure we use the
 * same connection since it may hold relevant locks or have uncommitted
 * writes. In that case we "assign" the task to a connection by adding
 * it to the task queue of specific connection (in
 * AssignTasksToConnectionsOrWorkerPool). Otherwise we consider the task
 * unassigned and add it to the task queue of a worker pool, which means
 * that it can be executed over any connection in the pool.
 *
 * A task may be executed on multiple placements in case of a reference
 * table or a replicated distributed table. Depending on the type of
 * task, it may not be ready to be executed on a worker node immediately.
 * For instance, INSERTs on a reference table are executed serially across
 * placements to avoid deadlocks when concurrent INSERTs take conflicting
 * locks. At the beginning, only the "first" placement is ready to execute
 * and therefore added to the readyTaskQueue in the pool or connection.
 * The remaining placements are added to the pendingTaskQueue. Once
 * execution on the first placement is done the second placement moves
 * from pendingTaskQueue to readyTaskQueue. The same approach is used to
 * fail over read-only tasks to another placement.
 *
 * Once all the tasks are added to a queue, the main loop in
 * RunDistributedExecution repeatedly does the following:
 *
 * For each pool:
 * - ManageWorkPool evaluates whether to open additional connections
 *   based on the number unassigned tasks that are ready to execute
 *   and the targetPoolSize of the execution.
 *
 * Poll all connections:
 * - We use a WaitEventSet that contains all (non-failed) connections
 *   and is rebuilt whenever the set of active connections or any of
 *   their wait flags change.
 *
 *   We almost always check for WL_SOCKET_READABLE because a session
 *   can emit notices at any time during execution, but it will only
 *   wake up WaitEventSetWait when there are actual bytes to read.
 *
 *   We check for WL_SOCKET_WRITEABLE just after sending bytes in case
 *   there is not enough space in the TCP buffer. Since a socket is
 *   almost always writable we also use WL_SOCKET_WRITEABLE as a
 *   mechanism to wake up WaitEventSetWait for non-I/O events, e.g.
 *   when a task moves from pending to ready.
 *
 * For each connection that is ready:
 * - ConnectionStateMachine handles connection establishment and failure
 *   as well as command execution via TransactionStateMachine.
 *
 * When a connection is ready to execute a new task, it first checks its
 * own readyTaskQueue and otherwise takes a task from the worker pool's
 * readyTaskQueue (on a first-come-first-serve basis).
 *
 * In cases where the tasks finish quickly (e.g. <1ms), a single
 * connection will often be sufficient to finish all tasks. It is
 * therefore not necessary that all connections are established
 * successfully or open a transaction (which may be blocked by an
 * intermediate pgbouncer in transaction pooling mode). It is therefore
 * essential that we take a task from the queue only after opening a
 * transaction block.
 *
 * When a command on a worker finishes or the connection is lost, we call
 * PlacementExecutionDone, which then updates the state of the task
 * based on whether we need to run it on other placements. When a
 * connection fails or all connections to a worker fail, we also call
 * PlacementExecutionDone for all queued tasks to try the next placement
 * and, if necessary, mark shard placements as inactive. If a task fails
 * to execute on all placements, the execution fails and the distributed
 * transaction rolls back.
 *
 * For multi-row INSERTs, tasks are executed sequentially by
 * SequentialRunDistributedExecution instead of in parallel, which allows
 * a high degree of concurrency without high risk of deadlocks.
 * Conversely, multi-row UPDATE/DELETE/DDL commands take aggressive locks
 * which forbids concurrency, but allows parallelism without high risk
 * of deadlocks. Note that this is unrelated to SEQUENTIAL_CONNECTION,
 * which indicates that we should use at most one connection per node, but
 * can run tasks in parallel across nodes. This is used when there are
 * writes to a reference table that has foreign keys from a distributed
 * table.
 *
 * Execution finishes when all tasks are done, the query errors out, or
 * the user cancels the query.
