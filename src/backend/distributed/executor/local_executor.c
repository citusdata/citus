/*
 * local_executor.c
 *
 * The scope of the local execution is locally executing the queries on the
 * shards. In other words, local execution does not deal with any local tables
 * that are not on shards on the node that the query is being executed. In that
 * sense, the local executor is only triggered if the node has both the metadata
 * and the shards (e.g., only Citus MX worker nodes).
 *
 * The goal of the local execution is to skip the unnecessary network round-trip
 * happening on the node itself. Instead, identify the locally executable tasks
 * and simply call PostgreSQL's planner and executor.
 *
 * The local executor is an extension of the adaptive executor. So, the executor
 * uses adaptive executor's custom scan nodes.
 *
 * One thing to note is that Citus MX is only supported with replication factor
 * to be equal to 1, so keep that in mind while continuing the comments below.
 *
 * On the high level, there are 3 slightly different ways of utilizing local
 * execution:
 *
 * (1) Execution of local single shard queries of a distributed table
 *
 *      This is the simplest case. The executor kicks at the start of the adaptive
 *      executor, and since the query is only a single task the execution finishes
 *      without going to the network at all.
 *
 *      Even if there is a transaction block (or recursively planned CTEs), as
 *      long as the queries hit the shards on the same node, the local execution
 *      will kick in.
 *
 * (2) Execution of local single queries and remote multi-shard queries
 *
 *      The rule is simple. If a transaction block starts with a local query
 *      execution,
 *      all the other queries in the same transaction block that touch any local
 *      shard have to use the local execution. Although this sounds restrictive,
 *      we prefer to implement it in this way, otherwise we'd end-up with as
 *      complex scenarios as we have in the connection managements due to foreign
 *      keys.
 *
 *      See the following example:
 *      BEGIN;
 *          -- assume that the query is executed locally
 *          SELECT count(*) FROM test WHERE key = 1;
 *
 *          -- at this point, all the shards that reside on the
 *          -- node is executed locally one-by-one. After those finishes
 *          -- the remaining tasks are handled by adaptive executor
 *          SELECT count(*) FROM test;
 *
 *
 * (3) Modifications of reference tables
 *
 *		Modifications to reference tables have to be executed on all nodes. So,
 *      after the local execution, the adaptive executor keeps continuing the
 *      execution on the other nodes.
 *
 *		Note that for read-only queries, after the local execution, there is no
 *      need to kick in adaptive executor.
 *
 *  There are also a few limitations/trade-offs that are worth mentioning.
 *  - The local execution on multiple shards might be slow because the execution
 *  has to happen one task at a time (e.g., no parallelism).
 *  - If a transaction block/CTE starts with a multi-shard command, we do not
 *  use local query execution since local execution is sequential. Basically,
 *  we do not want to lose parallelism across local tasks by switching to local
 *  execution.
 *  - The local execution currently only supports queries. In other words, any
 *  utility commands like TRUNCATE, fails if the command is executed after a local
 *  execution inside a transaction block.
 *  - The local execution cannot be mixed with the executors other than adaptive,
 *  namely task-tracker executor.
 *  - Related with the previous item, COPY command cannot be mixed with local
 *  execution in a transaction. The implication of that is any part of INSERT..SELECT
 *  via coordinator cannot happen via the local execution.
