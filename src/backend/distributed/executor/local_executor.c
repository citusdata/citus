/*
 * local_executor.c
 *
 * The scope of the local execution is locally executing the queries on the
 * shards. In other words, local execution does not deal with any local tables
 * that are not shards on the node that the query is being executed. In that sense,
 * the local executor is only triggered if the node has both the metadata and the
 * shards (e.g., only Citus MX worker nodes).
 *
 * The goal of the local execution is to skip the unnecessary network round-trip
 * happening on the node itself. Instead, identify the locally executable tasks and
 * simply call PostgreSQL's planner and executor.
 *
 * The local executor is an extension of the adaptive executor. So, the executor uses
 * adaptive executor's custom scan nodes.
 *
 * One thing to note that Citus MX is only supported with replication factor = 1, so
 * keep that in mind while continuing the comments below.
 *
 * On the high level, there are 3 slightly different ways of utilizing local execution:
 *
 * (1) Execution of local single shard queries of a distributed table
 *
 *      This is the simplest case. The executor kicks at the start of the adaptive
 *      executor, and since the query is only a single task the execution finishes
 *      without going to the network at all.
 *
 *      Even if there is a transaction block (or recursively planned CTEs), as long
 *      as the queries hit the shards on the same, the local execution will kick in.
 *
 * (2) Execution of local single queries and remote multi-shard queries
 *
 *      The rule is simple. If a transaction block starts with a local query execution,
 *      all the other queries in the same transaction block that touch any local shard
 *      have to use the local execution. Although this sounds restrictive, we prefer to
 *      implement in this way, otherwise we'd end-up with as complex scenarious as we
 *      have in the connection managements due to foreign keys.
 *
 *      See the following example:
 *      BEGIN;
 *          -- assume that the query is executed locally
 *          SELECT count(*) FROM test WHERE key = 1;
 *
 *          -- at this point, all the shards that reside on the
 *          -- node is executed locally one-by-one. After those finishes
 *          -- the remaining tasks are handled by adaptive executor
 *          SELECT count(*) FROM test;
 *
 *
 * (3) Modifications of reference tables
 *
 *		Modifications to reference tables have to be executed on all nodes. So, after the
 *		local execution, the adaptive executor keeps continuing the execution on the other
 *		nodes.
 *
 *		Note that for read-only queries, after the local execution, there is no need to
 *		kick in adaptive executor.
 *
 *  There are also few limitations/trade-offs that is worth mentioning. First, the
 *  local execution on multiple shards might be slow because the execution has to
 *  happen one task at a time (e.g., no parallelism). Second, if a transaction
 *  block/CTE starts with a multi-shard command, we do not use local query execution
 *  since local execution is sequential. Basically, we do not want to lose parallelism
 *  across local tasks by switching to local execution. Third, the local execution
 *  currently only supports queries. In other words, any utility commands like TRUNCATE,
 *  fails if the command is executed after a local execution inside a transaction block.
 *  Forth, the local execution cannot be mixed with the executors other than adaptive,
 *  namely task-tracker executor. Finally, related with the previous item, COPY command
 *  cannot be mixed with local execution in a transaction. The implication of that any
 *  part of INSERT..SELECT via coordinator cannot happen via the local execution.
