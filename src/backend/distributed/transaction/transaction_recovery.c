	 * We could avoid this by temporarily blocking new prepared transactions
	 * from being created by taking an ExlusiveLock on pg_dist_transaction.
	 * However, this hurts write performance, so instead we avoid blocking
	 * by consulting the list of active distributed transactions, and follow

	 * 1) P = prepared transactions on worker
	 * 2) A = active distributed transactions

	 * 4) Q = prepared transactions on worker
	 *
	 * By observing A after P, we get a conclusive answer to which distributed
	 * transactions we observed in P are still in progress. It is safe to recover
	 * the transactions in P - A based on the presence or absence of a record
	 * in T.
	 *
	 * We also remove records in T if there is no prepared transaction, which
	 * we assume means the transaction committed. However, a transaction could
	 * have left prepared transactions and committed between steps 1 and 2.
	 * In that case, we would incorrectly remove the records, while the
	 * prepared transaction is still in place.
	 *
	 * We therefore observe the set of prepared transactions one more time in
	 * step 4. The aforementioned transactions would show up in Q, but not in
	 * P. We can skip those transactions and recover them later.
