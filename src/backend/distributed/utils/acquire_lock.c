 * acquire_lock.c
 *	  A dynamic background worker that can help your backend to acquire its locks. This is
 *	  an intrusive way of getting your way. The primary use of this will be to allow
 *	  master_update_node to make progress during failure. When the system cannot possibly
 *	  finish a transaction due to the host required to finish the transaction has failed
 *	  it might be better to actively cancel the backend instead of waiting for it to fail.
 *
 * This file provides infrastructure for launching exactly one a background
 * worker for every database in which citus is used.  That background worker
 * can then perform work like deadlock detection, prepared transaction
 * recovery, and cleanup.
