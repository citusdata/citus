# Regression tests that exercise distributed planning/execution functionality.

# All new regression tests are expected to be run by this schedule. Tests that
# do not set specific task executor type should also be added to
# multi_task_tracker_extra_schedule.
#
# Note that we use variant comparison files to test version dependent regression
# test results. For more information:
