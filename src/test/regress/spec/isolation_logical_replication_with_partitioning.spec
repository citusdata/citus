// This file is adapted from isolation_logical_replication_single_shard_commands.spec
// in order to separate testing of partitinoned and non-partitioned
// tables. We do that to enabled testing of logical replication
// on older postgres versions that do not support partitioning yet.
// When we drop support for PG 96 we should consider merging this
// file with isolation_logical_replication_single_shard_commands.spec
// We used 5 as the partition key value through out the test
// so setting the corresponding shard here is useful
