-- MULTI_MULTIUSER_LOAD_DATA
--
-- Tests for loading data in a distributed cluster. Please note that the number
-- of shards uploaded depends on two config values: citusdb.shard_replication_factor and
-- citusdb.shard_max_size. These values are manually set in pg_regress.c. We also set
-- the shard placement policy to the local-node-first policy as other regression
-- tests expect the placements to be in that order.
SET citusdb.shard_placement_policy TO 'local-node-first';
