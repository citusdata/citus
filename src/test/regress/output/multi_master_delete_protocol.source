ERROR:  cannot run DELETE command which targets multiple shards
HINT:  Consider using an equality filter on partition column "c_custkey" to target a single shard. If you'd like to run a multi-shard operation, use master_modify_multiple_shards(). You can also use master_apply_delete_command() to drop all shards satisfying delete criteria.
