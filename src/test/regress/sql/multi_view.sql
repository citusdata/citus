-- MULTI_VIEW
--

-- This file contains test cases for view support. It verifies various
-- Citus features: simple selects, aggregates, joins, outer joins
-- router queries, single row inserts, multi row inserts via insert
-- into select, multi row insert via copy commands.

-- count distinct on partition column is not supported

-- left join support depends on flattening of the query
-- following query fails since the inner part is kept as subquery

-- view at the inner side of is not supported

-- but view at the outer side is. This is essentially the same as a left join with arguments reversed.
