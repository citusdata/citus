-- PG17-specific tests go here.

-- Purpose: Verify PG18 behavior that NOT NULL constraints are materialized
--          as pg_constraint rows with contype = 'n' on both coordinator and
--          worker shards. Also confirm our helper view (table_checks) does
--          NOT surface NOT NULL entries.
