-- Check that join-pruning works for joins between two large relations. For now
-- we only check for join-pruning between locally partitioned relations. In the
-- future we want to check for pruning between re-partitioned relations as well.

-- Partition pruning left three shards for the lineitem and one shard for the
-- orders table. These shard sets don't overlap, so join pruning should prune
-- out all the shards, and leave us with an empty task list.

-- These tests check that we can do join pruning for tables partitioned over
-- different type of columns including varchar, array types, composite types
-- etc. This is in response to a bug we had where we were not able to resolve
-- correct operator types for some kind of column types.
