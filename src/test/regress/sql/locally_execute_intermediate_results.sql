- subPlans needed remotely as the subquery is pushed down

-- the second subquery needs to be recursively planned due to non-colocated subquery join
-- so cte_2 becomes part of master query of that recursive subquery planning
WITH cte_1 AS (SELECT max(value) FROM table_1),

-- now, forcing all subqueries to be on the local node
WITH cte_1 AS (SELECT max(value) FROM table_1),

SELECT * FROM
  (SELECT value AS key FROM table_1 GROUP BY value HAVING max(value) > (SELECT * FROM cte_1) LIMIT 1) as foo,
