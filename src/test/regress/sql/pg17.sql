-- PG17 has the capabilty to pull up a correlated ANY subquery to a join if
-- the subquery only refers to its immediate parent query. Previously, the
-- subquery needed to be implemented as a SubPlan node, typically as a
-- filter on a scan or join node. This PG17 capability enables Citus to
-- run queries with correlated subqueries in certain cases, as shown here.
-- Relevant PG commit:
-- https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=commitdiff;h=9f1337639

-- This feature is tested for all PG versions, not just PG17; each test query with
-- a correlated subquery should fail with PG version < 17.0, but the test query
-- rewritten to reflect how PG17 optimizes it should succeed with PG < 17.0
