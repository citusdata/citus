-- The following views are intended as alternatives to \d commands, whose
-- output changed in PostgreSQL 10. In particular, they must be used any time
-- a test wishes to print out the structure of a relation, which previously
-- was safely accomplished by a \d invocation.
--
-- As we propagate CREATE VIEW commands when the view doesn't depend on an
-- un-distributable dependency, all below views are implictly propagated as
-- they only depend on catalog objects, which are created by initdb for each
-- node separately and so are not assumed to be un-distributable by
-- GetUndistributableDependency().
