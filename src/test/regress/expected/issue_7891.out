-- This test validates that the query planner correctly handles nested subqueries involving both a
-- local table (t4_pg) and a reference table (t2_ref). The steps are as follows:
--
-- 1. A dedicated schema (issue_7891) is created, and three tables (t2_ref, t4_pg, t6_pg) are set up.
-- 2. The table t2_ref is designated as a reference table using the create_reference_table() function.
-- 3. Sample data is inserted into all tables.
-- 4. An UPDATE is executed on t6_pg. The update uses an EXISTS clause with a nested subquery:
--    - The outer subquery iterates over every row in t4_pg.
--    - The inner subquery selects c15 from t2_ref.
-- 5. The update should occur if the nested subquery returns any row, effectively updating t6_pg's vkey to 43.
-- 6. The final state of t6_pg is displayed to confirm that the update was applied.
--
-- Note: This test was originally designed to detect a planner bug where the nested structure might
-- lead to an incorrect plan (such as a 0-task plan), ensuring proper handling of reference and local tables.
