# Regression tests that exercise distributed planning/execution functionality.
#
# All new regression tests are expected to be run by this schedule. Tests that
# do not set specific task executor type should also be added to 
# multi_task_tracker_extra_schedule.
#
# Note that we use variant comparison files to test version dependent regression
# test results. For more information:

# Tests around schema changes, these are run first, so there's no preexisting objects.

# The following distributed tests depend on creating a partitioned table and
# uploading data to it.

# Miscellaneous tests to check our query planning behavior

# Parallel tests to check our join order planning logic. Note that we stage data
# below; and therefore these tests should come after the execution tests.

test: multi_join_order_tpch_small multi_join_order_additional
test: multi_stage_more_data
test: multi_join_order_tpch_large

# ----------
# Tests for large-table join planning and execution.
# Be careful when staging new data before these tests, as they
# expect specific shard identifiers in the output.

# ---------
test: multi_outer_join

# ---
# Tests covering mostly modification queries and required preliminary
# functionality related to metadata, shard creation, shard pruning and
# "hacky" copy script for hash partitioned tables.
# Note that the order of the following tests are important. multi_complex_count_distinct
# is independed from the rest of the group, it is added to increase parallelism.
