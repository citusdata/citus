# This test cannot be run with run_test.py currently due to its dependence on
# the specific PG versions that we use to run upgrade tests. For now we leave
# it out of the parallel line, so that flaky test detection can at least work
# for the other tests.

# This attempts dropping citus extension (and rollbacks), so please do
