-- MULTI_STAGE_MORE_DATA
--

-- We stage more data to customer and part tables to test distributed joins. The
-- staging causes the planner to consider customer and part tables as large, and
-- evaluate plans where some of the underlying tables need to be repartitioned.
-- We also set the shard placement policy to the local-node-first policy as other
-- regression tests expect the placements to be in that order.

SET citusdb.shard_placement_policy TO 'local-node-first';
