# For echo commands "set -x" would show the message effectively twice. Once as
# part of the echo command shown by "set -x" and once because of the output of
# the echo command. We do not want "set -x" to show the echo command. We only
# want to see the actual message in the output of echo itself. This function is
# a trick to do so. Read the StackOverflow post below to understand why this
# works and what this works around.
