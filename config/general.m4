# config/general.m4

# This file defines new macros to process configure command line
# arguments, to replace the brain-dead AC_ARG_WITH and AC_ARG_ENABLE.
# The flaw in these is particularly that they only differentiate
# between "given" and "not given" and do not provide enough help to
# process arguments that only accept "yes/no", that require an
# argument (other than "yes/no"), etc.
#
# The point of this implementation is to reduce code size and
# redundancy in configure.in and to improve robustness and consistency
# in the option evaluation code.


# Convert type and name to shell variable name (e.g., "enable_long_strings")

#          [ACTION-IF-YES], [ACTION-IF-NO], [ACTION-IF-ARG],
#          [ACTION-IF-OMITTED])
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# This is the base layer. TYPE is either "with" or "enable", depending
# on what you like.  NAME is the rest of the option name.
# HELP-STRING-LHS-EXTRA is a string to append to the option name on
# the left-hand side of the help output, e.g., an argument name.  If
# set to "-", append nothing, but let the option appear in the
# negative form (disable/without).  HELP-STRING-RHS is the option
# description, for the right-hand side of the help output.
# ACTION-IF-YES is executed if the option is given without an argument
# (or "yes", which is the same); similar for ACTION-IF-NO.
