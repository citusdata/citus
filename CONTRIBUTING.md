### Getting and building

#### Mac

1. Install Xcode
2. Install packages with Homebrew

  ```bash
  brew update
  brew install git postgresql
  ```

3. Get, build, and test the code

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/citusdata/citus.git

  cd citus
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  make install
  cd src/test/regress
  make check
  ```

#### Debian-based Linux (Ubuntu, Debian)

1. Install build dependencies

  ```bash
  echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" | \
       sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list
  wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | \
       sudo apt-key add -
  sudo apt-get update

  sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-server-dev-9.6 postgresql-9.6 \
                          libedit-dev libselinux1-dev libxslt-dev  \
                          libpam0g-dev git flex make libssl-dev    \
                          libkrb5-dev cmake
  ```

2. Get, build, and test the code

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/citusdata/citus.git
  cd citus
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ..
  sudo make install
  cd src/test/regress
  make check
  ```

#### Red Hat-based Linux (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)

1. Find the PostgreSQL 9.6 RPM URL for your repo at [yum.postgresql.org](http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php#pg96)
2. Register its contents with Yum:

  ```bash
  sudo yum install -y <url>
  ```

3. Install build dependencies

  ```bash
  sudo yum update -y
  sudo yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools'
  sudo yum install -y postgresql96-devel postgresql96-server    \
                      libxml2-devel libxslt-devel openssl-devel \
                      pam-devel readline-devel git

  git clone https://github.com/citusdata/citus.git
  cd citus
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake -PG_CONFIG=/usr/pgsql-9.6/bin/pg_config ..
  sudo make install
  cd src/test/regress
  make check
  ```

### Following our coding conventions

Travis will automatically reject any PRs which do not follow our coding conventions, it
won't even run tests! The easiest way to ensure your PR adheres to those conventions is
to use the [citus_indent](https://github.com/citusdata/tools/tree/develop/uncrustify)
tool.

  ```bash
  # Ubuntu does have uncrustify in the package manager however it's an older
  # version which doesn't work with our citus-style.cfg file. We require version
  # 0.60 or greater. If your package manager has a more recent version of uncrustify
  # feel free to use that instead of installing from source
  git clone --branch uncrustify-0.60 https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify.git
  pushd uncrustify
  ./configure
  sudo make install
  popd

  git clone https://github.com/citusdata/tools.git
  pushd tools/uncrustify
  make install
  popd
  ```

Once you've done that, you can run the `citus_indent` command to recursively check and
correct the style of any source files in the current directory. You can also run `make
reindent` from within the Citus repo to correct the style of all source files in the
repository.
