### What is Citus?

* **Open-source** PostgreSQL extension (not a fork)
* **Scalable** across multiple hosts through sharding and replication
* **Distributed** engine for query parallelization
* **Highly available** in the face of host failures

Citus horizontally scales PostgreSQL across commodity servers using
sharding and replication. Its query engine parallelizes incoming
SQL queries across these servers to enable real-time responses on
large datasets.

Citus extends the underlying database rather than forking it, which
gives developers and enterprises the power and familiarity of a
traditional relational database. As an extension, Citus supports
new PostgreSQL releases, allowing users to benefit from new features
while maintaining compatibility with existing PostgreSQL tools.
Note that Citus supports many (but not all) SQL commands; see the
[FAQ][faq] for more details.

Common Use-Cases:
* Powering real-time analytic dashboards
* Exploratory queries on events as they happen
* Large dataset archival and reporting
* Session analytics (funnels, segmentation, and cohorts)

   docker-compose -p citus up -d
   ```

* Connect to the master database
   ```bash
   docker exec -it citus_master psql -U postgres -d postgres
   ```

* Follow the [first tutorial][tutorial] instructions
